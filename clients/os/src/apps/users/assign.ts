// WHICH RUNGS THIS CALLER IS OFFERED FOR THIS PERSON.
//
// ===========================================================================
// A MIRROR OF auth.MayAssignRole, AND ONLY A MIRROR
// ===========================================================================
// component/auth/rbac_assignment.go is the authority: both seams that assign a
// role -- SetUserRole and invitation issue -- run it against the role the
// stream interceptor verified, and nothing decided in this browser changes its
// answer. What this decides is which rungs are OFFERED, which is presentation
// (design record, section E) and matters for one reason: a ladder that offers
// every rung teaches an operator that they may hand out any of them, and they
// find out otherwise by being refused.
//
// So the unoffered rungs are DRAWN, dashed, with the sentence -- rather than
// dropped. A rung that vanished would leave somebody comparing two people's
// pages and seeing two different ladders with nothing to explain the
// difference.
//
// THE RULES, in the Go's own order, and each one is here because leaving it
// out would offer something the server refuses:
//
//  1. the role must be one this cluster can assign: active, and known.
//  2. the caller must hold the people-authority grant at all -- `update` on
//     `principal` to re-role somebody, `create` on `admission` or `principal`
//     to name a role on an INVITATION. That split is memql#4917's: a developer
//     invites people and does not re-role them.
//  3. the caller must govern the person as they stand today (strictly above
//     them, or an owner).
//  4. the new rung must sit strictly below the caller's own -- unless the
//     caller is an owner, the carve-out that makes a second owner possible.
//  5. the new role must hold no `principal` verb the caller does not, whatever
//     the ranks say. developer ranks ABOVE admin and holds fewer principal
//     verbs, so rank alone would let a developer mint an admin who can then
//     re-role anybody.
//  6. an account-scoped role is offered only for somebody already in that
//     account's group. An unanswerable membership question is a NO, exactly as
//     a nil `targetIsMember` refuses server-side.
