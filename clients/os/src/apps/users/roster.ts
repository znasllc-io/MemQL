// ===========================================================================
// ONE LIST, TWO FEEDS, AND NO "INVITES" SECTION
// ===========================================================================
// An invitation is a person who has not arrived (design record, D1). The app
// used to answer "who is on this cluster" in two places -- a roster and an
// Invites section -- so somebody looking for a colleague had to know whether
// that colleague had accepted yet, which is the one thing they were trying to
// find out.
//
// The join is `useTwoFeedView`, whose header states why a `useLiveView`
// transform reading a second feed silently drops rows. What arrives here is
// both snapshots, and what leaves is one ordered list.
