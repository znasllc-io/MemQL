// the live list -- and a people picker is not vocabulary, it is one domain's
// surface. The kit gains nothing domain-shaped.
//
// All three are PRESENTATION over rows the caller already holds. None of them
// reads, and none of them decides what anybody may do: the engine refuses the
// write it would refuse whatever these render. What they decide is what is
// OFFERED, which is a courtesy to the person reading and never the boundary.
