// `v1:identity:groupMembership` is every membership in the cluster: one row
// per person per group, forever, including the removed ones the concept keeps
// as history. A cluster-wide collection over it would seed all of them to
// render ONE page -- the Deployables timeline argument, and the reason the
// account rollups are on-demand reads rather than four more subscriptions.
//
// So the two reads below are SCOPED: `membersOfGroup` for an opened group and
// `groupsForUser` for an opened person, each seeded with its own argument.
// They are still LiveCollections, because both concepts broadcast created and
// updated to browser subscribers (component/node/routing.go) -- and a
// subscription is scoped by CONCEPT and cannot be scoped by argument, which is
// exactly what `inScope` is for: it says about an arriving event what the
// read's own filter said server-side. Without it, adding somebody to any group
// in the cluster would fold a row into the page you happen to have open.
//
// The reads go through the GENERATED builders (`make sdk-gen`), which is what
// keeps the argument names in step with the DSL: a query whose argument was
// renamed fails to compile here rather than answering nothing at runtime.
