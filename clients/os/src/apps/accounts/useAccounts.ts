// which broadcasts creates and deliberately not updates, because the row
// churns on lastSeenAt -- an account carries no field that moves on a timer,
// so there is nothing to strobe and both verbs are affordable.
//
// The rule the README states is to read the routing table before deciding
// what a feed does, and the case that makes it load-bearing here is the boot
// seed: `v1:accounts:account:self` is materialized by whichever bff replica
// wins the startup race, which is not the replica any browser is attached to.
// Without the broadcast, the first-run card would keep asking for a company
// name on a cluster that already had a row waiting.

 * settings.ts). Seeding filtered would make the toggle re-run the read and
 * re-baseline every arrival cue, so flipping it would announce the whole list
 * as new.
 *
 * The gate is the query's own -- the concept's composite tier is ANDed into
 * the read whatever this code asks for -- so a caller sees exactly their own
 * accounts, or every one if they are a cluster owner. Nothing here decides
