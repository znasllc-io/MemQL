 * The seed writes the canonical id and the row is stored under it, so the
 * canonical spelling is the one every server-side file in this feature says --
 * the automation, the query, the design record. None of that reaches a
 * browser. The engine STRIPS the `{concept}:` prefix at every egress seam
 * (docs/public/concepts/identifiers.md, machine-checked by
 * component/grpc/wire_bare_ids_test.go, which fails the build if a canonical
 * id leaks), so a client receives `self` and the contract's own sentence is
 * "clients never compose, parse, or compare a canonical id".
 *
 * Holding the canonical string here compared it against a bare one, so
 * `accountIsSelf` was FALSE for the self row and stayed false forever. Nothing
 * errored: the first-run card never rendered on a cluster that had never been
 * configured, the `you` chip never appeared, and the owner's own company read
 * as an ordinary client -- three surfaces silently wrong, all from one
 * comparison. The OS suite passed throughout because its harness seeds
 * `accountRow({ id: SELF_ACCOUNT_ID })`, so both sides of the comparison were
 * whatever this constant said.
