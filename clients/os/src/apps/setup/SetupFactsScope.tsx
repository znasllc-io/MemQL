// ===========================================================================
// THREE SURFACES NOW ASK THE SAME QUESTION
// ===========================================================================
// The core gate before the desk, the effect that decides whether the setup
// widget is on a desk at all, and the widget's own gate. They must not each
// ask it. `passkeysForSelf` is an on-demand read, so a hook per surface is a
// read per surface on every boot -- and two readings of one person's
// credentials are free to disagree, which is a gate that lifts on one surface
// while another still holds. SetupGate's own header made that argument when
// there were two consumers; there are now three.
//
// ===========================================================================
// IT SITS ABOVE THE DESK
// ===========================================================================
// The presence effect has to run when the widget is NOT on the desk, which is
// exactly when the widget's own gate is not mounted. So this provider is
// mounted in Shell.tsx, inside SessionScope (it reads the feed) and outside
// ShellRoster (the effect runs inside the desk, and the gate runs instead of
// it).
