// REQUEST/REPLY WITH AN EXPLICIT REFRESH, not a subscription, and the reason
// is sharper here than on the sections beside it: `providerAuthStatus` is a
// projection of THIS NODE's in-memory provider registry, not of rows anyone
// writes, so there is no graph event to subscribe to. A panel that appeared
// live while showing a registry that stopped moving would invite an operator
// to trust a reading taken minutes ago -- which on this surface is the
// difference between "the key took" and "the key took on the replica you
// happened to reach".
//
// WHICH REPLICA ANSWERED IS NOT KNOWABLE FROM HERE, and the section says so
// rather than implying a fleet-wide reading. The front door routes each call
// independently, so two Refreshes can be answered by two nodes. That is why
// Apply broadcasts rather than relying on repeated reads.
//
// THERE IS NO KEY HERE ANY MORE (epic memql#5088, D5). `saveKey` and the
// key-sealing builtin it called are deleted, not disabled: federation is the
// only door for a cloud vendor, and the fleet is the other door. What is left
// on the write side is the federation id form, per vendor, and Apply.
