// (epic memql#5103).
//
// ===========================================================================
// LIVE, UNLIKE EVERY OTHER READING ON THIS PANEL
// ===========================================================================
// The Models SECTION's two readings are deliberately not live -- `fleetModels`
// and `inferenceStatus` are virtual projections with no `graph.node.*` event
// behind them, so a collection over either would render "Loading from the
// cluster" and then a list that never moves.
//
// v1:worker:modelPull is the opposite: a real row, written on the agent replica
// driving the download and carrying a broadcast routing rule
// (component/node/routing.go) precisely so it reaches this browser. A pull
// takes minutes, the person who pressed the button is watching, and a
// re-read button would be asking them to poll by hand.
//
// So this app now has both kinds on one screen, which the Cluster app's rule
// warns about. The distinction is legible here rather than confusing because
// the two are about different things: the catalog answers "what can the fleet
// run" and is a snapshot with a timestamp, while a pull is an EVENT WITH A
// DURATION and says so by moving.
