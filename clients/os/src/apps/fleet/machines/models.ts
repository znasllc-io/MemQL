// What ONE machine runs, and what is being pulled onto it (epic memql#5103).
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE MACHINE'S OWN LABELS ARE THE SOURCE, NOT THE FLEET CATALOG
// ===========================================================================
// `fleetModels` answers "what can this caller run", folded across every
// machine. This surface asks the opposite question -- "what does THIS machine
// run" -- and the fold cannot answer it: a model both machines offer appears
// once, with the union of their capabilities, so reading a machine's row out
// of the catalog would attribute a sibling's structured-output support to a
// machine that never claimed it.
//
// The machine's own `model:<id>` labels are the machine's own claim, and they
// are already on the registration row this panel renders. So this is a
// projection, not a read: no query, no loading state, and it moves with the
// heartbeat that carries the labels.
//
// ===========================================================================
// PURE, AND SEPARATE FROM THE COMPONENT
// ===========================================================================
// The same reason rows.ts states: a projection asserted through render() is
// asserted through three layers that can each fail for unrelated reasons.
// Everything here is a function of a label map or a row.
