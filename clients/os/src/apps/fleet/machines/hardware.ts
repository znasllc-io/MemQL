// What a machine IS, as its cockpit reported it (epic memql#5146, D1).
//
// ===========================================================================
// THIS FILE'S WHOLE JOB IS TELLING THREE ABSENCES APART
// ===========================================================================
// Everything on the Hardware group is a reported fact or the lack of one, and
// there are three different lacks. They lead to different actions and a page
// that renders them alike is worse than one that says nothing:
//
//   NOT REPORTED   the cockpit predates the field. Nothing is wrong, nothing
//                  to fix, and the machine is working normally.
//   UNDER THE FLOOR the machine reported and the answer is no. There is a
//                  fix and it costs money.
//   NOT MEASURED   nobody has probed this model here yet. There is a fix and
//                  it is a button.
//
// The generic rendering collapses all three into a blank or a zero. Keeping
// them apart is the design, so every reader here returns a state rather than a
// value, and the group renders a SENTENCE per state rather than a dash.
