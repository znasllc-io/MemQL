// THE MIRROR OF auth.MayAssignRole, ASSERTED (memql#5236).
//
// This module decides which rungs a ladder OFFERS, and pickers.tsx passes the
// answer straight to `disabled`. So a rule stricter than the engine's does not
// show a refusal -- it removes the control, and the operator has nothing to
// read. That is exactly what shipped: the engine learned that a developer may
// invite an admin and this file kept refusing it, so the fix was live and
// unreachable.
//
// It had no test at all, in an app with ten of them. These are the cases that
// would have caught it.
