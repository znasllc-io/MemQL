// domainjoin.go -- an account's own domain as a way in (epic memql#5165, D9).
//
// When a person arrives -- an invitation accepted, a first sign-in -- and their
// email address is on a domain an account has PROVEN it owns and has switched
// joining on for, they land in that account's group.
//
// # Three conditions, and every one of them is load-bearing
//
//  1. THE ADDRESS MUST BE VERIFIED, and the seam that knows says so. An
//     unverified claim is a string a provider did not check, and joining on it
//     is the same class of mistake as LINKING on it -- which the OIDC
//     federation rule already refuses by name. There is no default here: the
//     caller passes the flag, because only the caller knows.
//
//  2. THE ACCOUNT'S DOMAIN MUST BE `verified`. Before that the domain is a
//     string somebody typed, and anyone who can create an account could claim
//     gmail.com and collect every arriving Gmail user.
//
//  3. `joinOnDomain` MUST BE ON. Proving you own a domain is not the same as
//     asking for everyone on it, and a client whose staff share a domain with
//     their customers wants exactly one of those.
//
// # Never retroactive
//
// This runs at ARRIVAL and touches nobody already here. Turning the flag on
// does not sweep the existing roster, and that is the decision rather than an
// omission: a sweep would silently place people who joined the cluster for
// some other reason, and the person turning the flag on has no list of who it
// would move.

// ApplyDomainJoin places a newly-arrived person in the group of the account
// whose verified domain matches their verified email address.
//
// IDEMPOTENT, and returns the group it joined them to (empty when it did
// nothing) so a caller can log the fact. A no-op is the ordinary answer: most
// people arrive on an address no account claims.
//
// IT NEVER FAILS AN ARRIVAL. Every refusal path returns ("", nil) rather than
// an error, because this is the last step of provisioning a user and the row
// is already written -- reporting a failure here would surface as "sign-in
// failed" to somebody whose account exists and works. A genuine engine error
// is returned, and its callers log rather than abort for the same reason.
