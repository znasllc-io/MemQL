// accountdoor_accounts.go -- the two reads that tell the sweep which doors
// SHOULD exist (epic memql#5168, design D).
//
// # WHY THE SWEEP IS DRIVEN FROM THE ACCOUNT SIDE
//
// A door's own work list (`accountFrontDoorsToReconcile`) excludes `live`,
// because a healthy cluster's steady state is doors that are already serving
// and re-checking them every two minutes would make the good case the
// expensive one. But `live` is exactly the state a WITHDRAWN reservation has
// to reach out of (design D9), so something has to notice.
//
// That something is this: one read of the accounts that HOLD a reservation,
// one read of the doors that are open, and the difference in both directions.
// A reservation with no door opens one; a door with no reservation, or one
// whose name has moved, is asked to tear down. The cost is a read whose size
// is the number of accounts an operator typed, once every two minutes.

// Reservation is one account's held MemQL name.
type Reservation struct {
	AccountID    string

	// Reason is the reservation reason CURRENTLY on the row, so the sweep can
	// skip a write that would change nothing. lastCheckedAt is not touched by
	// this write, so a no-op write would still version the row -- and a row
	// versioned every two minutes for every account is the strobe the arrival
	// cue's own rule exists to prevent.

// that verifies the domain, and only when it also passed the guardrails -- so
// a non-empty `memqlDomain` with no `memqlReservedAt` is a name somebody typed
// that this cluster has not agreed to serve, and opening a door for it would
// request a certificate for a host whose ownership is unproven.
