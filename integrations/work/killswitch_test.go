// handler: internal origin, and the executor's own system actor. Built here

// about is the ORIGIN, and a helper that also carried a role would let a test
// pass for the wrong reason.

// The acceptance the issue names is two properties, and the second one is the
// hard one:
//
//	Flipping computerUseEnabled to false stops in-flight computer-use work,
//	with a test that FAILS against the pre-dispatch gate alone.
//	The selection is no broader than "runs actually using the worker".
//
// The first is easy to satisfy accidentally -- "cancel every run of that
// user" passes it -- so the file below is mostly about the second. Note what a
// query-matching fake CANNOT prove here: it has no row-authz gates, so
// "the write ran as the owner" is asserted as the ACTOR ON THE CALL rather
// than as a permission outcome. recorder_test.go's header states that
// standard; the enforcement itself is the concept's tier and
// TestRowAuthzEnforcementLandGate.
