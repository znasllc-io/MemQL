// killswitch.go -- the in-flight half of the computer-use kill switch,
// rebuilt on the work spine (memql#5066).
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT WAS THERE, AND A CORRECTION TO THE RECORD
// ===========================================================================
// `killSwitchSuspendsRunningPlans` moved a user's running computer-use Plans
// to awaitingFeedback when `preferences.computerUseEnabled` flipped false. It
// went with the Plan concepts in memql#5053, on three findings -- and the
// FIRST OF THEM WAS WRONG, which is worth writing down because it is why the
// deletion looked free.
//
// It said the automation "never fired": its query's doc comment recorded that
// `args.event.payload.id ?? ""` reached argument validation as an unevaluated
// CoalesceExpr (memql#2870). That WAS true, and it stopped being true on
// 2026-07-27 in 8ef364cd7 ("evaluate expressions passed as nested-call
// arguments"), six weeks before the deletion. The doc comment survived its own
// fix, and memql#5066 inherited it as fact. component/memql's
// nested_call_arg_eval_test.go is the evidence either way: the sibling cases
// it drives through the real resolver -- magicLinkExpirySweep's bare `now`,
// deployGateGreen's root coalesce -- pass on main today.
//
// So this restores a control that was live, rather than building one that
// never was. The other two findings stand and shape what is below.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE SELECTION, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
// ===========================================================================
// The old predicate was `computerUseScope != null` -- "the plans actually
// using the worker". `v1:work:run` carries no computer-use marker, and adding
// one would put a field on the run concept to carry a scope it does not
// otherwise need. The alternative offered was cancelling EVERY in-flight run
// of that user, which is far broader than the control ever was.
//
// Neither is necessary. `v1:worker:invocation.runId` already names the run a
// call was made inside -- re-pointed from planId to run id by memql#5053 --
// so "runs actually using the worker" is a fact already recorded, per call,
// by the dispatcher. It is also STRICTER than the old predicate: a plan with a
// computerUseScope was one AUTHORIZED to use a machine, while an invocation
// row is one that DID.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY IT STARTS FROM THE RUNS
// ===========================================================================
// The set is { run : owner is U, status is running, some invocation names it }.
// It is read runs-first because that is the bounded side: a person has a
// handful of runs in flight and may have tens of thousands of invocation rows
// behind them. Starting from the invocations would page through call history
// to rediscover a set the run table already holds.
//
// ===========================================================================
// AUTHORITY: INTERNAL ORIGIN, WHICH IS THE GATE THIS EXACT SURFACE TAUGHT
// ===========================================================================
// The argument names WHOSE runs to stop, so it IS the authorization decision
// and an ungated builtin taking it is a primitive for cancelling somebody
// else's work. memql#2888 hardened precisely this shape, and its rule is
// quoted in component/automations/executor.go above ExecuteWithClientEvent --
// naming this automation's predecessor as the worked example:
//
//	run_automation("killSwitchSuspendsRunningPlans", {node:{id: <any user>}})
//	reached runningPlansForUser (@serverOnly) with an attacker-chosen userId
//	and then transitioned every plan it returned [...] a cross-user write, not
//	just a read leak.
//
// The fix was that internal origin requires BOTH a trusted SOURCE (an
// automation from the registered tree, not a caller-submitted bundle) AND a
// trigger payload the caller did not supply. That is exactly the pair this
// handler needs, so it gates on origin and nothing else.
//
// NOT a cluster-owner floor, which was the first shape tried here and is the
// wrong one twice over: it does not stop the attack above (the payload, not
// the role, is what is chosen), and clearing it would put the automation on
// component/auth/maintenance_actor.go's list -- whose own gate test states the
// standard an entry must meet, "its reads span owners BY NATURE [...] not
// merely finding an owner-scoped read inconvenient. For that, borrow ONE
// owner's authority". This acts on one owner. So it borrows.
//
// Everything after the gate runs under the AFFECTED OWNER's borrowed
// authority: v1:work:run's write guard ignores the clusterOwner arm of its
// composite tier, so a write as anyone but the owner is refused. That is
// handleCancelGoal's rule, and this obeys it for the same reason.
