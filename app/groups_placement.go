// groups_placement.go -- placing an arriving person in their groups (epic
// memql#5165, section G).
//
// The two ARRIVAL SEAMS -- an invitation accepted, a first sign-in -- both end
// with a user row and an address. This is what turns that into memberships:
// the groups the invitation named, and then the account whose verified domain
// matches a verified address.
//
// # It lives in app/ because it is WIRING
//
// component/identity must not depend on integrations/, and integrations/groups
// must not know what an invitation is. Both halves are right, so the node --
// which already holds every store it is assembling -- is where they meet. The
// seams take a function; this builds it.
//
// # It never fails an arrival
//
// Every path logs and returns. By the time it runs the user row exists and the
// invitation is spent, so there is no failure it could report that the caller
// could act on: an error would render "your invitation could not be accepted"
// to somebody whose account was just created, and leave them unable to retry
// because the invitation is single-use. A missing membership is one click for
// an admin; a lost arrival is a support ticket.

// placerEngine narrows the engine to the one method integrations/groups needs.

// It exists because the two Execute signatures differ: the engine returns a
// typed *ExecuteResult and the groups package -- which must not import
// component/memql's result type to stay a narrow seam -- takes `any`. The
// plug-in factory has the same adapter for the same reason; this is the one
// caller that builds the integration directly rather than through the
// registry, and it needs its own.
//
// GO DOES NOT COERCE THE SIGNATURE, so leaving this out compiles everywhere
// except under the `identity` build tag, which is the only build that reaches
// the wiring below. That failure is invisible to `go build ./...` and to
