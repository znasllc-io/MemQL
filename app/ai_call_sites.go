package app

// ai_call_sites.go -- every model call app/ makes, as a named request
// (epic memql#5127, design D2).
//
// # Why the requests are functions rather than literals
//
// Each of these sites used to name a provider: `VisionProvider()`,
// `EmbeddingProvider(ctx, name)`, `StructuredChatProviderByName(ctx, name)`.
// A name at a call site is a release every time the fleet changes, it records
// no decision, and no rule an operator wrote can see it. Re-pointed, each site
// declares the LEVEL it needs and the MODALITY it derives, and the router
// picks.
//
// The declaration is only worth as much as its checkability, and a request
// built inline inside a closure is not checkable: a table test that asserts
// nothing because the requests are unreachable is worse than no table at all.
// So each site's request is a named function over its inputs, and
// call_site_levels_test.go is the table that pins the level and modality of
// every one of them.
//
// # Two of these resolve at BOOT, and that is deliberate
//
// The safety classifier and the healer are composed once during wiring, and
// their provider is chosen then. That is the shape they already had -- a nil
// provider left the layer off rather than failing the node -- and it is the
// honest one for a layer that is either present for the process's life or
// absent from it. The vision getter is the opposite: it is a CALLBACK,
// resolved per call, because a file uploaded an hour after boot must see the
// fleet as it is then.

// visionResolveRequest is an image or a document handed to a model that can
// look at it: extracting text from a scan, describing a picture in a Library
// file.
//
// FAST, because this is extraction rather than reasoning -- the answer is fed
// to a chunker and an index, not read by a person. Needs.Vision is asserted
// even though the modality already implies it: the modality says which
// interface the client must satisfy, the need says what the MODEL must be able
// to do, and epic 3's local door reads the second when deciding whether a
// machine's model can serve the call.
//
// The context floor is left to the seam's default, and the reason is that
// nothing better is knowable here: this request picks a provider, and the
// bytes it will be shown arrive later, at Extract time.

// to, and nothing downstream can tell the difference.
//
// The caller-supplied name is a PIN, not a lookup -- it rides ExplicitProvider
// and wins over every rule, while still passing through the doors and the
// ledger. The pinned embedding model id on a binding stays exactly as it is
// this epic; epic memql#5137 owns re-pointing it, so nothing changes on the

// because the schema is the whole point: a provider that answers prose here
// produces a parse failure that reads as a model problem.

// patches over a template that already exists, and a person approves it before
// anything changes (design D5). Nothing is emitted or repaired on this call.
