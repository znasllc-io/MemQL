package app

// call_site_levels_test.go -- the table that pins what every model call app/
// makes declares (epic memql#5127, design D2, record section 6).
//
// # What it is for
//
// A re-pointed call site is a diff somebody read unless something checks it.
// The whole claim of this epic is that a call declares a LEVEL and derives a
// MODALITY -- and a site that silently declared `fast` where it needed
// `strong`, or `chat` where the caller type-asserts a structured provider,
// would compile, resolve, and be wrong in a way that only shows up as a worse
// answer or a mid-call type failure. Neither reads as a routing bug.
//
// So each site's request is a named function in ai_call_sites.go, and this is
// the table over them. A row here is the contract for one site; changing a
// site's level is then a deliberate two-file edit rather than a one-character
// one.
//
// # Why the table asserts the REQUEST and not the resolution
//
// What the router does with a request is the router's own tests. What this
// package is responsible for is the request: the level it asked for, the
// modality it derived, the needs it asserted, and whether a caller-named
// provider became a PIN rather than a lookup. Those are properties of a pure
// function over values, so this test needs no engine, no registry and no
// database -- which is what makes it a gate that actually runs rather than one
// that skips.
