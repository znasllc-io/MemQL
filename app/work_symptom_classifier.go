// work_symptom_classifier.go -- the ONE model call the work spine's failure
// path may make (epic memql#5127, design D12).
//
// # It is reached on a table miss and nowhere else
//
// component/work's symptom table is consulted first and classifies most
// failures with no provider call at all. This runs only when the table returns
// "no opinion", which is why the prompt it invokes is the cheapest in the tree
// and why the whole implementation is one render, one call and one parse.
//
// The headline property the work spine's design claimed -- a rules-classified
// symptom makes ZERO provider calls -- is only checkable if this seam can be
// counted, which is why component/automations declares it as an interface
// rather than reaching for the engine directly.
//
// # It declares its level and never a model
//
// The classifySymptom prompt carries @level("fast"), and the request built
// here says the same thing. Nothing in this file names a provider: which model
// serves a fast structured call is the router's decision, made from the rules,
// and recorded on v1:router:call. Level() is on the interface so a test can
// assert the cheapest tier without reaching into this file -- the tier is a
// property of the design, not an implementation detail.
