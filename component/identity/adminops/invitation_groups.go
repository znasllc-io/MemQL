// invitation_groups.go -- the groups an invitation carries (epic memql#5165,
// section G).
//
// An invitation may name the groups its recipient JOINS on acceptance, and
// every one of them is validated HERE, at issue, rather than at acceptance.
//
// # Why at issue
//
// Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters. The obvious one is that
// a refusal at issue reaches the person who can act on it -- the inviter, who
// chose the groups -- while a refusal at acceptance reaches the invitee, who
// cannot. The load-bearing one is the RANK rule: an invitation must not place
// somebody where the inviter could not have placed them by hand, and the
// inviter is only present at issue. Checked at acceptance it would be checked
// against the invitee, which is a different question with a different answer.
//
// # The rank rule is the same one groupMemberAdd applies
//
// The invitee's role must rank strictly below the inviter's. That is not a
// second policy: an invitation carrying a group is a deferred groupMemberAdd,
// and letting it skip the rule would make "invite them into the group" the way
// round a guard that refuses "add them to the group".
