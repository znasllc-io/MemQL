// The federation-exchange observer (memql#4335).
//
// One call in the whole engine has this shape: it spends no tokens, it is not
// an LLM request, and when it stops working every Claude provider in the mesh
// stops working with it -- but not immediately. The SDK holds a valid bearer
// for up to an hour, so a rule that was deleted, a service account that was
// disabled, or a projected token whose audience drifted keeps serving traffic
// right up until the last good token expires. The failure is therefore
// invisible at the moment it is caused and arrives, un-attributable, up to an
// hour later.
//
// That is what this observer exists for, and it is why it is a counter plus a
// log line carrying Anthropic's OWN error body rather than a wrapped message:
// the body names the reason the Console's authentication-events tab will show
// (`match_subject_prefix`, `workspace_id_required`, ...), and an operator who
// has that string can act without reading any of our code.

// federationTokenPath is the SDK's token endpoint, taken from the SDK's own
// exported constant rather than re-typed. If Anthropic moves it, the SDK bump
// moves this with it instead of leaving a matcher that silently matches
// nothing (which would read as "no exchanges are happening").
const federationTokenPath = config.TokenEndpoint

// openaiFederationTokenPath is OpenAI's RFC 8693 exchange path. Unlike
// Anthropic's it is not exported by an SDK -- the engine performs this exchange
// itself (design D3) -- so it is written here beside the matcher that reads it.
const openaiFederationTokenPath = "/oauth/token"

// federationExchangeVendor reports which vendor's token exchange a request is,
// or "" when it is not one.
//
// Matched on METHOD + PATH, and deliberately not on host. The host at the
// moment of the check is whatever base URL the client was built with, which in
// tests is a loopback httptest server; pinning api.anthropic.com or
// auth.openai.com would make the observer untestable and would silently stop
// observing anything against a base-URL override.
//
// THE ORDER OF THESE TWO CHECKS IS LOAD-BEARING. Anthropic's path is
// /v1/oauth/token and OpenAI's is /oauth/token, so the OpenAI suffix matches
// BOTH. Testing Anthropic's longer, more specific path first is what keeps
// every Anthropic exchange from being attributed to OpenAI -- which would not
// fail anything, it would just quietly move one vendor's entire rate onto the
// other's series and leave a permanent zero where a real number belongs.
