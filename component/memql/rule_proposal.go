// rule_proposal.go -- would this rule load? (epic memql#5137)
//
// A RULE ARRIVES BY TWO FRONT DOORS AND MUST BE JUDGED IDENTICALLY. An
// operator fills in a form in MemQL OS; an operator types a sentence and a
// model compiles it. Both end up as a rendered `rule` construct that the
// loader either accepts or refuses, so anything one door lets through that the
// other does not is a rule that validates, renders, and then fails -- with the
// person holding a confident account of what it does.
//
// WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN EITHER DOOR. `component/routingrules` is the form
// door and lives in the root module; `component/router` is the compiler door
// and is a LEAF module the root depends on. Neither can import the other, and
// the first attempt to share by importing was a dependency-direction violation
// the module-boundaries lane caught -- correctly, and invisibly to both
// `go build ./...` and `make test`. This package is what they already share:
// it owns RuleConfig, RuleWhenKeys and the OnUnavailable values, and it
// already imports the policy-entry parser.
//
// THE POINT IS TO SHARE THE PREDICATES, NOT TO SHARE A LIST. The state this
// replaces was four literals restated in component/router -- the shipped rule
// names, the shipped policy names, the @when keys and the onUnavailable values
// -- and three of them were wrong when they were written. One of them named a
// POLICY as a rule and missed four of the six rules the tree ships, so the
// gate that stops a custom rule shadowing a shipped one was, for
// `reasoningParks`, watching nothing. Lists like that do not drift because
// somebody is careless; they drift because the thing they copy is somewhere
// else and nothing connects them.
