// Does an OMITTED optional argument in a `stamp` block skip the field, or write
// it empty?
//
// # WHY THIS TEST EXISTS RATHER THAN AN ASSUMPTION
//
// `recordAccountDomainCheck` (epic memql#5165) has eight optional arguments
// and a `stamp` block naming all eight. Its one caller, the domain walk in
// `integrations/customdomain/account_domain.go`, advances a row by at most one
// state per pass and OMITS the arguments that state says nothing about --
// which is only correct if omission is a skip. If it is a blank, that caller
// erases `domainToken` on every pass that does not mint one, and the ownership
// token a client published is lost while the walk reports progress.
//
// Epic memql#5168 then adds a ninth argument (`memqlReservationReason`) and
// writes it from a DIFFERENT sweep, which passes only that one. So the
// question stopped being academic: if omission blanks, that write would clear
// the whole domain walk on every front-door pass.
//
// The intent is documented in both places. The BEHAVIOUR was documented
// nowhere, and a shared assumption held by two callers is exactly the kind
// that is discovered by a client losing their verification.
//
// # THE ANSWER, AND THE HALF THIS TEST DOES NOT COVER
//
// Omission is a SKIP: the key is absent from the delta and the read-merge
// inherits the stored value. memql#5165's author measured the same thing
// independently and found the sharper half -- `args.X ?? ""` materialises an
// explicit empty string, which is PRESENT in the delta and WINS the merge. So
// the danger is not omission, it is somebody adding a `??` default to one of
// these lines for tidiness. That trap is guarded where a person would write it
// (a comment in the mutation body) rather than here, and by
// TestAnOmittedOptionalArgLeavesItsStampFieldUntouched, which is landing in a
// follow-up PR and drives the generic property with a `??` negative control.
//
// This test stays because it covers the specific caller this epic depends on:
// recordAccountDomainCheck, written with one field by the front-door sweep.
//
// Postgres-gated like its neighbours. CI's db-tests lane runs this package
// with MEMQL_REQUIRE_DB=1, so a skip there is a failure rather than a green.
