// The ledger read takes three fields off every row it is handed, and a query
// returns the shape it declares and NOTHING ELSE. So the shape and the read
// have to agree, and nothing in the compiler makes them: a field the shape does
// not project arrives as an empty string, which is a value rather than an error.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, when it is `executionSurface`. Every row fails the `fleet:`
// prefix check, every call is skipped, the fold sees zero, and the sentence
// handed to the person who lent their machine is "No calls have run on this
// machine this week." A specific claim, made on no evidence, to the one reader
// entitled to a true answer -- and it renders identically to the honest zero.
//
// This is not hypothetical. The read shipped pointed at `routerCallEvidence`,
// the evidence fold's shape, which projects model / promptName / outcome /
// errorCategory / billing and none of these three. It compiled, every unit test
// over the pure fold passed, and the answer was silently always zero.
//
// The banned-field test below guards the opposite direction, and it is the one
// that will be tempting to relax: `routerDecision` (epic memql#5127) DOES
// project all three of these fields, so pointing the ledger at it would make
// the first two tests pass. It also projects promptName, model and the costs,
// which is the whole of what this reader is promised they do not get.

// Two instances of one shape in one epic is why this is a gate rather than a
