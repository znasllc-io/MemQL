// Seeding AI provider configuration FROM THE PORTAL (epic memql#4440, D4).
//
// WHY THESE EXIST RATHER THAN THE PORTAL CALLING setGlobalSecret. That
// mutation takes `encryptedValue` and `fingerprint` -- already sealed. The
// sealing is `component/secret.Encrypt`, which reads MEMQL_MASTER_KEY, and the
// master key exists on nodes and must never exist in a browser. So a page that
// called the mutation directly could only ever write a row nothing can
// decrypt, or would need the cluster's decryption key shipped to every
// operator's laptop.
//
// The seam is therefore server-side, exactly as the Shopify connector's
// `seedSecret` is (integrations/shopify/config.go): take the plaintext, seal
// it here, write the row. What crosses the wire from the browser is the key
// itself, once, over the same TLS-terminated gRPC stream every other call
// uses -- and it is never sent back.
//
// THE NAMES ARE NOT A PARAMETER, and that is the whole safety property. An
// operator cannot mistype the row name into one the resolver never tries and
// then watch a correctly-entered key do nothing. They pick a VENDOR; this file
// knows the name.
