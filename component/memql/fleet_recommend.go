// The RECOMMENDED SET (epic memql#5146, design D2).
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT IT ANSWERS
// ===========================================================================
// "Which of the catalog's models should THIS machine pull?" -- one per level,
// strongest first, from the profiles the machine's class reaches and whose
// runtime the machine has.
//
// It is computed ON THE ENGINE rather than on the cockpit, and that placement
// is the decision. The catalog lives in the graph, so a cockpit computing its
// own recommendation would be reading a copy; one function here is what every
// surface, the machine page and the install wizard's fleet door all read.
//
// ===========================================================================
// A PROFILE THAT CANNOT BE PULLED IS RETURNED, NOT DROPPED
// ===========================================================================
// The obvious shape for this function is a filter, and a filter is wrong here.
// A profile ruled out by a missing runtime, by the wrong operating system or by
// a class it does not reach is the profile a person is looking for when they
// ask why their machine cannot do voice; dropping it answers that question with
// silence, and silence is indistinguishable from a catalog that never had one.
//
// So a Recommendation carries `Blocked`: empty when the profile is pullable, and
// otherwise the SENTENCE saying why, written once here and rendered by the
// machine page and the act alike. Two spellings of one reason drift, and the
// drift shows up as a page that explains one thing while the refusal says
// another.
//
// ===========================================================================
// AN ABSENT INVENTORY RECOMMENDS NOTHING AND BLOCKS NOTHING
// ===========================================================================
// Not an empty recommendation with every profile blocked -- an EMPTY LIST.
// There is nothing to say about a machine that has not reported, and a page
// listing every profile as blocked reads as a machine that failed rather than
// one that has not spoken.
