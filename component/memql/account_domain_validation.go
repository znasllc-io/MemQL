// THE ACCOUNT'S DOMAIN WALK, GUARDED (epic memql#5165, design D9 and D10).
//
// Two rules that a mutation body cannot state, beside the self-archive guard
// and for the same reason its siblings live here: one reads an environment
// value, and both judge a COMBINATION of fields rather than a single one.
//
//  1. `joinOnDomain: true` BEFORE `domainStatus == "verified"`. The flag says
//     "a person arriving with a verified email on this domain joins this
//     account's group". Before ownership is proven, the domain is a string
//     somebody typed -- so accepting the flag would let anyone who can create
//     an account claim `gmail.com` and collect every arriving Gmail user into
//     their group. Refused as `domain_not_verified`, never silently corrected:
//     an operator who set the flag meant to set it, and quietly storing
//     `false` would leave them believing joining is on.
//
//  2. A `memqlDomain` UNDER THIS CLUSTER'S OWN DOMAIN, or equal to one of its
//     front-door hosts. Reserving `os.<domain>` or `api.<domain>` for a client
//     is a request to serve a name the platform already answers on, and the
//     custom-domain policy refuses the same two things for the same reason
//     (platform_custom_domain_policy.go). The cluster's domain comes from the
//     environment, so no mutation body can ask.
//
// NO ESCAPE FOR EITHER, deliberately -- not internal origin, not the cluster
// owner. The reconciler and the seed both write values that PASS these rules,
// so an escape would buy nothing but a way for a future writer to put an
// unservable name into the row and discover it at certificate-issuance time.
//
// A NOTE ON WHAT IS NOT GUARDED HERE. `domainStatus: "verified"` itself is
// writable by the reconciler and by anyone who may write the row, and that is
// not an oversight: `@requiresRank("admin")` on the account mutations is what
// bounds who may write at all, and a client's domain is the operator's record
// to state. The rule this file enforces is narrower and sharper -- that the
// two things which CONSUME verification cannot get ahead of it.
