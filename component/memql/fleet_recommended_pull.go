// The `fleetPullRecommended` ACT (epic memql#5146, design D2).
//
// ===========================================================================
// ONE ACT, NOT A LIST OF BUTTONS
// ===========================================================================
// A person who has just paired a Mac Studio should not have to decide which
// four models to pull, in which order, and then press four buttons and watch
// four progress bars. The catalog knows which models suit a machine of this
// class and the engine knows the machine's class; the whole of what is left for
// a person to say is "yes, do that".
//
// So this act opens one pull record PER MODEL, in the recommended order,
// through the SAME path the per-model act uses. It does not invent a second
// pull mechanism: `createModelPull` writes the row, the claiming replica runs
// it, `workerModelPullStaleSweep` catches the abandoned ones. What this adds is
// the SET and the ORDER, which is exactly the part the catalog can answer and a
// person cannot.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY EACH REFUSAL IS BEFORE ANY WRITE
// ===========================================================================
// Every refusal here happens before the first row is written, so a partly-
// executed set is not a state this act can leave behind. That matters more than
// it looks: a person watching four bars, two of which will never move, cannot
// tell a queue from a failure.
