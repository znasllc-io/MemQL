// RunDelivery routes the run-lifecycle graph events (graph.node.created /
// graph.node.updated for v1:work:run) through the durable DeliverySubstrate
// (memql#1264, the #1263 outbox + cursor backbone), giving run dispatch a real
// at-least-once delivery leg (memql#1495) instead of relying on the mesh
// fast-path alone.
//
// PORTED FROM THE PLAN LIFECYCLE (memql#5053). It was PlanDelivery, and the
// incident that produced it is the reason it was ported rather than deleted
// with the concept: the durability claim in eventbridge.go ("the mesh
// fast-path is purely a latency optimization; the durable substrate is the
// delivery guarantee") did NOT hold for graph events that ride the broadcast
// ONLY. When the broadcast was dropped while the consuming node was routeless
// -- the mesh peer-table decay incident (memql#1388, PR #1494) -- the event
// never arrived and the work stranded.
//
// The work spine has exactly that shape: v1:work:run events are broadcast
// (component/node/routing.go), and the RUN DISPATCHER (memql#5054) consumes
// them off its local bus to claim and execute a run. A dropped broadcast means
// a compiled run that nobody executes -- which the abandoned sweep then closes
// with a message about a node going away. So the guarantee moves with the
// mechanism.
//
// What did NOT move is the recovery backstop: the plan side had the #1389
// stranded-plan watchdog polling the database, and the run side has no
// equivalent. That makes this leg MORE load-bearing here than it was there,
// not less.
//
// RunDelivery mirrors ChatReplyDelivery exactly, with the parallel addressing
// inversion (physical "deliver to agent-pod-N" -> logical "deliver to whoever
// executes runs"):
//
//   - Producer side (every mesh node that emits a run graph event): on a
//     LOCAL, non-remote run graph event, Publish a Deliverable to the
//     substrate keyed by the fixed logical key run:lifecycle. The durable
//     outbox row is the guarantee; the EventBridge mesh broadcast stays as the
//     deduped low-latency fast-path. A run row is written by the node that
//     opened it and by the node executing it, so both run the producer side.
//   - Consumer side (executing replicas only): one Subscribes ONCE to
//     run:lifecycle on the substrate and re-publishes each deliverable onto
//     its LOCAL bus -- where the run dispatcher's subscription already
//     consumes it -- then Acks. The durable cursor means a replica whose mesh
//     route was dead when a run event was produced catches up on cursor-pull
//     replay, which is the route gap that would otherwise leave a compiled run
//     unexecuted until the abandoned sweep closed it.
//
// Idempotency vs the mesh copy -- DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT from chat-reply.
// ChatReplyDelivery SUPPRESSES the inbound mesh copy on the bff because the
// browser must receive each reply EXACTLY ONCE and the substrate is its single
// delivery path. Run events have no such constraint, and the reason is the
// dispatcher's own design: it CLAIMS a run before executing it, against a
// Postgres-backed guard keyed on the run id (memql#5054). So a run event
// arriving on BOTH the mesh fast-path and the durable replay is collapsed by
// that claim; the mesh copy is NOT suppressed. RunDelivery is purely an
// ADDITIONAL at-least-once path -- it can only ADD a delivery an executing
// replica would otherwise have missed, never cause a double-execution, because
// the dedup lives in the consumer rather than at the substrate boundary.
//
// Exactly-once for a single occurrence is still the substrate's per-subscription
// EventID dedup (the durable-pull copy and any mesh-hint copy of the same
// EventID collapse to one re-publish); per-key ordering is the substrate's
// per-key monotonic seq + cursor. The EventID is the run row id suffixed with
// the bus event's emission timestamp (see publish), so a status transition that
// re-inserts under the same run id (MemQL is append-only; each write is a new
// row VERSION under the same logical id) still gets a distinct durable row
// rather than being swallowed by the outbox's EventID uniqueness -- the same
// per-occurrence keying the chat-reply presence path needed (memql#1324).
