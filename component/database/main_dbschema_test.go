// TestMain ensures the schema exists before this package's db-gated cases run
// (memql#2551), which is the precondition for joining the `db-tests` lane.
//
// The lane runs per-package binaries as PARALLEL PROCESSES against ONE
// database, so without this the first db-gated case here would race every other
// package's migration -- and a migration race does not fail cleanly, it fails
// as whichever half lost.
//
// It lives in the EXTERNAL test package because that is where this package's
// db-gated file has to live: dbtest imports memory-nodes, which imports this
// package, so an in-package test importing dbtest is an import cycle. Both test
// packages compile into one binary, so this TestMain governs the in-package
// tests too.
//
// The db-gated cases self-skip when no Postgres is reachable and fail under
// MEMQL_REQUIRE_DB=1, exactly as every other db-gated package does.
