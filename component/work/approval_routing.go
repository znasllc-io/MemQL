// The ROUTING REVIEW approval (epic memql#5146, design D5).
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE ONE KIND WITH NO RUN
// ===========================================================================
// Every other approval parks a run: a step reached a side effect, a ceiling, a
// question, and the run waits. This one is raised by the nightly evidence fold,
// which is a sweep. There is no run to park, and a synthetic one would be a run
// that never ran, sitting in every list of runs forever.
//
// The concept's `runId` therefore lost its `!`, and this file is what keeps the
// invariant that bang used to carry -- because a schema can say "required" and
// cannot say "required except for one kind", where a function can say exactly
// that and NAME the kind in its refusal.

// ApprovalKindRoutingReview is the fold's proposal.
