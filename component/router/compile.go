// A described rule: a sentence, compiled once, into a rule a person confirms
// (epic memql#5137, D7).
//
// ===========================================================================
// COMPILED ONCE, NOT EVALUATED PER REQUEST
// ===========================================================================
// A person types "nothing that touches campaign recipients leaves the fleet".
// The alternative to compiling that is asking a model, per request, whether
// this request touches campaign recipients -- a model in front of every model
// call, which is the cost the whole program exists to avoid. So the sentence is
// compiled to a `rule` once, pinned, and from then on the router matches
// structurally at no cost.
//
// The owner's cache argument, adopted: the sentence does not change at request
// time, so its hash is the key and the compiled rule is the value.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE COMPILED FORM IS THE CONTRACT, THE SENTENCE IS THE RECORD
// ===========================================================================
// What runs is the rule. The sentence is kept as the rule's description so a
// later reader can see what was meant -- but if the two disagree, the rule is
// what the cluster does, and the simulation is how a person finds that out
// BEFORE confirming rather than from a bill afterwards.

// WhenKeys is the closed `@when` vocabulary the compiler hands to the model as
// the words it may use (epic memql#5127).
//
// IT IS THE LOADER'S OWN LIST, NOT A COPY OF IT. An earlier draft restated the
// seven literals here on the argument that a prompt vocabulary and a parser
// vocabulary are different things -- which is true right up until they differ,
// and then the compiler emits rules that refuse to load while telling the
// person, confidently, what their new rule does. Deriving costs nothing and
// removes the only way those two can disagree.
