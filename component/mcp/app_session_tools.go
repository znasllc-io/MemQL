// The app-session back-channel tools (epic memql#5096, task memql#5102,
// design D7 and D1).
//
// A delegated app reaches MemQL over MCP with a per-run credential whose
// `sub` is the OWNING USER's id and whose label names the session. These two
// tools are what that credential can do BEYOND reading the user's graph:
//
//	submit    hand back the structured answer for this session
//	nextTask  ask what this session was opened to do
//
// THEY ARE LISTED ONLY FOR AN APP-SESSION BEARER, and that gating is not
// cosmetic. `tools/list` is what a model reads to decide what it can do, so a
// browser session offered `submit` would be offered an action that can only
// fail -- and a model shown a tool it cannot use spends turns discovering
// that. The refusal in the handler is the backstop; the absence from the list
// is the mechanism.
//
// THE SESSION ID COMES FROM THE CREDENTIAL, NEVER FROM THE CALL. Neither tool
// takes a session argument, so an app cannot name somebody else's session even
// by accident. Row authz would refuse such a write anyway -- the app acts as
// its owner, and the session row is owner-tiered -- but a surface that does not
// offer the argument cannot be asked the question.
//
// WHY NOT A CROSS-NODE FORWARD. The session runs on an agent replica and this
// is the MCP node; the row is the state both can see. `submit` writes the
// answer onto the row and the runner reads it back at end, which needs no
// forward and works when the two nodes never speak. The alternative would be a
// NodeService hop whose failure mode is an app that submitted an answer nobody
// received.
