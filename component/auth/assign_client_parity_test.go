// THE ASSIGNMENT RULE, PINNED ACROSS THE TWO LANGUAGES THAT IMPLEMENT IT
// (memql#5236).
//
// WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. `clients/os/src/apps/users/assign.ts` is a
// REIMPLEMENTATION of MayAssignRole, not a caller of it: it shares no symbol
// with this package, so every search for callers of `MayAssignRole` -- which is
// how the change that broke it was scoped -- comes back with two Go call sites
// and no sign of it. The engine learned that a developer may invite an admin
// and the browser kept refusing, and because pickers.tsx feeds the answer to
// `disabled`, the fix shipped live and unreachable with no error anywhere.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. Not "the two answer the same
// for every input" -- that would need a JS runtime here, and the OS's own
// vitest suite is the right place for behaviour (test/users/assign.test.ts
// carries the cross product and the re-role control). What this gate holds is
// the STRUCTURE that the mirror can only get right on purpose:
//
//  1. both sides carry an explicit KIND rather than inferring the seam from an
//     empty target slug -- the inference both sides used, and the reason the
//     bug was expressible at all;
//  2. the people-authority clause is gated on the re-role kind on BOTH sides;
//  3. the refusal vocabularies correspond one-for-one, so a refusal this
//     package can return is one the browser has a word and a sentence for.
//
// A MISSING OR RENAMED FILE IS A FAILURE, NOT A SKIP, for the reason
// TestFleetOnlineWindowMatchesTheClients states: a gate that goes vacuous when
// a file moves goes vacuous exactly when the rule is most likely to have
// drifted.
