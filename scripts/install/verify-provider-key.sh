# ======================================
#
# Capability: install.verifyProviderKey -- prove a cluster's AI-provider
# credential works, by asking the cluster.
#
# THERE IS NO KEY ANY MORE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SHAPE OF THIS SCRIPT
# (epic memql#5088). MemQL reaches both AI vendors by workload identity
# federation: the credential is a projected Kubernetes service-account token
# that exists only inside a pod, exchanged for a bearer that lives at most an
# hour. Nothing long-lived is at rest, so there is nothing an installer could
# hand this script to verify.
#
# The `--key-file` mode is therefore GONE rather than deprecated. Keeping it
# would have been worse than removing it: it verified a credential the cluster
# does not use, which is a green check on the wrong thing.
#
# What is left is the probe that asks the running pod what it is really using:
#
#   kubectl exec <deploy> -- memql provider-auth check --provider=<vendor>
#
# The pod holds the token, so the pod is the only thing that can answer. Run it
# against more than one node type: each pod projects its own token, so "it
# works on agent" is not "it works".
#
# THE NAME IS OLDER THAN THE BEHAVIOUR. This file and its capability id still
# say "key"; both are referenced by the DSL action, the engine's capability
# allowlist, the install graph, the editor extension and its tests, so renaming
# them is a sweep of its own rather than a side effect of this one.
#
# EXIT CODES -- the distinction the installer branches on:
#
#   0  the vendor accepted the cluster's federated credential
#   2  bad param (unknown provider, no --federation-deploy)
#   3  REFUSED: the check RAN and the vendor did not accept the credential.
#      The federation configuration is wrong -- the provider or rule, the
#      subject, the audience, the service account. This is the federated
#      analogue of a 401 on a key, and it is what the operator re-does the
#      console steps for.
#   4  prerequisite missing (kubectl absent)
#   5  the check could not be RUN (no such deployment, no cluster, exec
#      refused). Says nothing whatever about the credential.
#
# The 3-versus-5 split is the reason this is not one exit code: "your mapping
# does not match" and "you are pointed at the wrong cluster" ask for opposite
# next actions, and `kubectl exec` collapses both into a non-zero exit unless
# they are told apart deliberately. They are told apart by whether the command
# RAN: kubectl exec returns the command's own status, and `provider-auth check`
# uses 1 for a refusal, so 1 is a refusal and anything else is a failure to run.
#
# This is a CAPABILITY SCRIPT: non-interactive, structured params in, a single
# JSON result envelope on stdout, human logs on stderr, honest exit codes.
